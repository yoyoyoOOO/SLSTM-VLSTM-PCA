# SLSTM and VLSTM-PCA
## About the project
For voids that retain their ellipsoidal characteristics during growth, the ellipsoidal void Semiaxes Long ShortTerm Memory (SLSTM) method is proposed, using the 3 principal features of the ellipsoid to represent the voids. For voids that undergo arbitrary shape changes during growth, an innovative deep learning method called Voronoi tessellation-assisted LSTM (VLSTM) is proposed. This method uses the Voronoi algorithm to standardize data features and employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform data compression before neural network training. This new method combines the Voronoi algorithm, LSTM neural networks, and PCA algorithms, and is termed as VLSTM-PCA.
